# Progress

## What Works
-   **Dashboard Performance:** The excessive API calls on the dashboard have been resolved, improving performance.
-   The static charts are now loading correctly.
-   The "limit" option for dynamic charts is fully functional.

## What's Left to Build
-   All major dashboard functionality is now complete. Future work will focus on enhancements and new features.

## Current Status
-   The application is in a stable and fully functional state.

## Known Issues
-   There are no known issues at this time.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
-   **`useSmartRefresh` Hook Optimization:** An issue causing excessive API calls was traced to the `useSmartRefresh` hook. The `useEffect` dependency array was not correctly using the `refreshOn` parameter, leading to unnecessary re-fetching. The logic has been updated to respect `refreshOn`, resolving the performance issue.
-   The investigation into the static chart loading issue revealed a logic flaw in the `useSmartRefresh` hook, which was not triggering a data fetch on the initial render. This has been corrected.
-   The "limit" functionality was not working due to the `ComponentConfigModal` handling the limit value as a string instead of a number. This has been resolved by ensuring the value is correctly converted.
-   The initial concern about an API contract mismatch was unfounded, as the frontend and backend were aligned.

# Progress

## What Works

- **GitHub OAuth2 Authentication**: The end-to-end authentication flow with GitHub is now fully functional. A series of complex issues, including session management conflicts, provider name extraction errors, incorrect credential usage, CORS misconfiguration, and a context key mismatch, have been diagnosed and resolved.
- **API Key Management**: Users can create, list, and delete API keys through the `UserProfile` component, which is essential for integrating with CI/CD pipelines and other external tools.
- **Protected Routes**: The `ProtectedRoute` component effectively guards protected routes, ensuring that only authenticated users can access them.
- **Routing**: The routing logic has been improved to handle authentication state changes correctly. Unauthenticated users are now redirected to a dedicated `/login` route, while authenticated users are redirected to the dashboard.
- **API Base Path**: The `authApi` service has been updated to use an absolute path for authentication requests, which resolves the 400 error that occurred when initiating login from the home page.
- **Proxy Configuration**: The Vite proxy has been updated to correctly rewrite the path for API requests, ensuring that they are properly routed to the backend.

## What's Left to Build

- **User Roles and Permissions**: The system currently lacks a role-based access control (RBAC) system, which is necessary for managing user permissions and restricting access to certain features.
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: To enhance security, 2FA should be implemented to provide an additional layer of protection for user accounts.
- **Audit Logs**: There is no auditing mechanism to track user activities, such as login attempts, API key creation, or other sensitive operations.

## Known Issues

- **No Rate Limiting**: The authentication endpoints lack rate limiting, which makes them vulnerable to brute-force attacks.
- **Insufficient Error Handling**: While basic error handling is in place, the system could benefit from more robust error handling and reporting to improve the user experience and facilitate debugging.

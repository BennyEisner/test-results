# Progress

## What Works

- A basic authentication system is in place.
- Users can authenticate via GitHub OAuth2 in a local development environment.
- Users can create and use API keys for authentication.
- The backend is structured using hexagonal architecture.
- The frontend has a basic `AuthContext` and protected routes.
- The application now builds successfully after fixing frontend and swagger generation issues.

## What's Left to Build

- **Deep Analysis of Auth System:** Conduct a deep analysis of the existing user and authentication system to identify what components are in place and what is missing.
- **Additional OAuth Providers:** Implement login with Google, Microsoft, etc.
- **Audit Logging:** Log authentication events for security monitoring.
- **Password Reset:** Implement password reset functionality.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Add MFA support.

## Current Status

The project is in a state where the foundational authentication system is complete. The next phase is to build upon this foundation with more advanced security and user management features.

## Known Issues

- **OAuth Redirect Issue:** When clicking "Continue with GitHub", the user is redirected to a non-existent endpoint. This needs to be fixed.
- The current implementation is for local development only. Production-level concerns like using Okta for OAuth, secure secret management, and HTTPS are not yet implemented.

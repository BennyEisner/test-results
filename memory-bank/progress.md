# Progress

## What Works

*   **Dashboard Rendering & Layout:** The dashboard renders, and the layout can be edited and saved.
*   **Stable Chart UI:** The `DataChart` component is now stable. It no longer gets stuck in a "loading" state or crashes when data is null, thanks to the implementation of request cancellation and memoization.
*   **Project/Suite Level Data:** Charts correctly display data when filtered at the project and suite levels.

## What's Left to Build

*   **Build-Level Chart Data:** The core issue of the "Test Case Pass Rate" chart not loading data at the build level needs to be resolved.
*   **Chart Readability and Aesthetics:** General improvements to chart readability (labels, colors, etc.) are still pending.
*   **Comprehensive Testing:** The dashboard requires thorough testing across all features and filter levels once the build-level issue is fixed.

## Current Status

The project is at a critical juncture. The UI-level bugs have been resolved, revealing a persistent, underlying issue with data fetching or processing at the build level. The immediate focus is on executing the `data_chart_investigation_plan.md` to perform a root cause analysis.

## Known Issues

*   **Build-Level Data Failure:** The "Test Case Pass Rate" chart consistently fails to display data when a specific build is selected. The root cause is unknown and is the subject of the current investigation.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

*   **Shift from UI to Data Investigation:** The debugging focus has shifted from fixing frontend race conditions to a systematic investigation of the entire data flow, from the frontend request to the backend database query.
*   **Adoption of Request Cancellation:** Implementing request cancellation in the `useSmartRefresh` hook has proven to be a valuable pattern for improving UI stability in asynchronous operations.

# Active Context

## Current Focus

The current focus is on understanding the newly implemented authentication system and determining the next steps for its development.

## Task

The user wants a step-by-step guide to the authentication system, including:
- How it works.
- How to set up the local development environment.
- How to test the authentication flows.
- Recommendations for the next features to implement.

## Recent Changes

- A new authentication system has been added with OAuth2 (GitHub) and API key support.
- The backend follows a hexagonal architecture.
- The frontend has an `AuthContext` for managing authentication state.
- Fixed frontend build errors related to unused variables.
- Fixed swagger generation issue.

## Important Decision

The user has clarified that this is an internal tool where all users should have equal access. Therefore, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is not needed at this time.

## Next Steps

1.  **Fix OAuth Redirect Issue:** When clicking "Continue with GitHub", the user is redirected to a non-existent endpoint. This needs to be fixed.
2.  **Deep Analysis of Auth System:** Conduct a deep analysis of the existing user and authentication system to identify what components are in place and what is missing.
3.  **Determine Next Feature:** Based on the analysis, determine which authentication enhancement to implement next from the remaining options:
    - Additional OAuth Providers (Google, Microsoft, etc.)
    - Audit Logging for security monitoring
    - Password Reset functionality
    - Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

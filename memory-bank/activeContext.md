## Current Focus: Resolving GitHub OAuth2 Authentication

The primary focus has been on debugging and resolving a series of issues that prevented the GitHub OAuth2 authentication from functioning correctly. The work involved a multi-step diagnostic process to identify and fix several distinct problems in the authentication flow.

## Summary of Fixes

The authentication system was plagued by several issues that were resolved sequentially:

1.  **Session Management Conflict**: The initial "you must select a provider" error was caused by a conflicting Goth initialization. The `main.go` file correctly configured a `CookieStore`, but this was being overwritten in `container.go` by a misconfigured `FilesystemStore`. The fix involved centralizing all Goth and session store configuration into `main.go` and removing the conflicting code from `container.go`.

2.  **Provider Name Extraction**: After fixing the session, a new issue arose where the provider name was not being correctly extracted from the request URL. This was resolved by implementing a custom `gothic.GetProviderName` function in `main.go` that manually and reliably parses the provider from the URL path.

3.  **Incorrect Client Credentials**: The final and most critical issue was an `incorrect_client_credentials` error from the GitHub API. Through diagnostic logging, it was discovered that the application was using the wrong environment variable names for the GitHub credentials.
    - The code was looking for `GITHUB_KEY` and `GITHUB_SECRET`.
    - The correct variables, as defined in the user's `.env` file, were `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`.

4.  **Final Correction**: The code in `main.go` was updated to load the correct `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variables. The `.env.example` file was also updated to reflect this change, ensuring future consistency.

## Next Steps

With the authentication code now fully corrected, the immediate next steps are:
1.  **User Configuration**: The user must ensure their local `.env` file is correctly populated with the `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` values from their GitHub OAuth application.
2.  **Verification**: Restart the Docker containers and perform an end-to-end test of the login flow to confirm that authentication is now working as expected.
3.  **Future Work**: Once authentication is verified, development can proceed with other planned features, such as implementing user roles and improving error handling.

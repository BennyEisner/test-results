## Current Focus: Root Cause Analysis of Data Chart Failures

The primary focus has shifted from fixing UI behavior to performing a root cause analysis of why the "Test Case Pass Rate" chart fails to display data at the build level. While UI stability has been improved, the underlying data issue persists.

## Recent Changes

To address UI instability (race conditions and "stuck in loading" states), the following changes were made:

1.  **`useSmartRefresh` Hook:**
    *   Integrated an `AbortController` to cancel in-flight `fetch` requests when a new request is initiated.
2.  **`dashboardApi` Service:**
    *   Updated the `getChartData` function to accept and use an `AbortSignal`.
3.  **`DataChart` Component:**
    *   Memoized the `fetcher` function using `useCallback` to prevent unnecessary re-renders and request cancellations.

These changes successfully stabilized the UI, but did not resolve the core data problem.

## Next Steps

The next step is to execute the `data_chart_investigation_plan.md`. This plan outlines a systematic approach to debugging the issue, starting from the frontend and moving to the backend to isolate the root cause.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

*   **Centralized State Management:** The use of `DashboardContext` is a key pattern for managing the dashboard's state.
*   **Backend for Frontend (BFF) Pattern:** The backend provides the frontend with the exact data it needs, simplifying frontend code.

## Learnings and Project Insights

*   **Separating UI and Data Issues:** It's crucial to differentiate between UI behavior bugs (like race conditions) and underlying data fetching/processing issues. Addressing them separately can lead to a clearer diagnosis.
*   **Value of Systematic Investigation:** When a problem is not immediately obvious, a structured investigation plan is essential to avoid circular debugging and ensure all potential causes are examined.

## Current Focus: Authentication System Fully Resolved

The GitHub OAuth2 authentication system is now fully functional after resolving a complex series of issues. The authentication flow works end-to-end, from OAuth callback through session management to protected route access.

## Summary of All Fixes

The authentication system required multiple sequential fixes to resolve all issues:

1.  **Session Management Conflict**: The initial "you must select a provider" error was caused by a conflicting Goth initialization. The `main.go` file correctly configured a `CookieStore`, but this was being overwritten in `container.go` by a misconfigured `FilesystemStore`. The fix involved centralizing all Goth and session store configuration into `main.go` and removing the conflicting code from `container.go`.

2.  **Provider Name Extraction**: After fixing the session, a new issue arose where the provider name was not being correctly extracted from the request URL. This was resolved by implementing a custom `gothic.GetProviderName` function in `main.go` that manually and reliably parses the provider from the URL path.

3.  **Incorrect Client Credentials**: An `incorrect_client_credentials` error from the GitHub API was resolved by fixing environment variable names. The code was looking for `GITHUB_KEY` and `GITHUB_SECRET`, but the correct variables were `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`.

4.  **CORS Configuration**: The backend's CORS middleware was misconfigured, preventing the frontend from successfully making authenticated requests. This was fixed by making the CORS middleware accept the frontend URL as a parameter.

5.  **Context Key Mismatch**: The final issue was a subtle bug where the `GetCurrentUser` handler was receiving a nil `auth_context` despite successful session validation. The problem was that the middleware used a private `authContextKey` type to store the context, but the handler was using a string literal to retrieve it. This was fixed by updating the handler to use the `middleware.GetAuthContext(r)` function instead of direct context value lookup.

## Current State

- **Authentication Flow**: Fully functional end-to-end
- **Session Management**: Working correctly with proper cookie handling
- **Protected Routes**: Successfully enforcing authentication requirements
- **Dashboard Access**: Users can now access dashboard content after login
- **API Integration**: Frontend can successfully communicate with protected backend endpoints

## Next Steps

With authentication fully resolved, development can now focus on:
1.  **Feature Development**: Implementing additional dashboard features and functionality
2.  **User Experience**: Improving error handling and user feedback
3.  **Security Enhancements**: Adding rate limiting, audit logs, and user roles
4.  **Testing**: Comprehensive testing of the authentication system under various scenarios

# Project Brief: Test Results

## Project Overview
- **Name**: Test Results
- **Type**: Full-stack web application
- **Description**: A comprehensive system designed to accept test results from various CI systems, store them in a centralized database, and provide a web-based dashboard for visualization and analysis.
- **Primary Goal**: To offer a centralized platform for tracking, analyzing, and managing software test results over time, improving visibility into test outcomes and trends.

## Target Audience
- **Primary Users**: Developers, Quality Assurance (QA) Engineers, and DevOps teams.
- **Use Cases**: 
    - Uploading JUnit and ReadyAPI test results from CI/CD pipelines using a CLI tool.
    - Viewing and analyzing historical test run data through a web dashboard.
    - Filtering test results by various parameters to identify patterns and diagnose failures.
- **User Needs**: A unified and accessible view of test results to monitor application quality and streamline the debugging process.

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Vite, Tanstack Table, Chart.js, React Router, Axios, Bootstrap
- **Backend**: Go, Gorilla Mux, Goth (for OAuth)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Deployment**: Docker, Nginx

## Key Features
1. **Test Result Ingestion**: A command-line interface (CLI) to parse and upload test results in JUnit and ReadyAPI XML formats.
2. **RESTful API**: A Go-based API that handles the creation, retrieval, and management of test data.
3. **Data Persistence**: A PostgreSQL database to store test results, suites, and execution metadata.
4. **Interactive Dashboard**: A React-based frontend that provides visualizations of test data, including tables and charts.
5. **Authentication**: Optional user authentication via GitHub OAuth2 to secure access to the application.
6. **Containerized Environment**: The entire application stack is containerized using Docker for consistent and simplified deployment.

## Project Constraints
- **Timeline**: Not explicitly defined in the repository, but a high-level milestone plan is present in the README.md.
- **Technical**: The project is designed around the specified technical stack. Adherence to Go and React best practices is expected.
- **Team**: No specific team information is available in the repository.

## Success Metrics
- **Key Performance Indicators**: Not explicitly defined, but could include metrics like the number of test results processed, API response times, and user engagement with the dashboard.
- **User Satisfaction Goals**: The application should be intuitive and provide valuable insights into test data, leading to high user satisfaction.

## Current Project State
The project appears to be in a well-developed and functional state. It has a clearly defined architecture, a complete set of features for its core functionality, and comprehensive documentation. The presence of a CI/CD workflow and detailed setup instructions suggests that the project is actively maintained and ready for use.

## Additional Notes
The repository is structured as a monorepo, containing the frontend, backend, and CLI in a single repository. This simplifies development and dependency management. The project also includes a strong emphasis on documentation and testing, as evidenced by the extensive `docs` directory and testing-related files.

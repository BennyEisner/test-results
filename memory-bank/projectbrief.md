# Project Brief: Test Results Platform

This project is a platform for tracking and managing software test results. It provides a web interface for users to view and analyze test data, and a CLI for programmatic access.

The system is composed of a Go backend API, a React frontend, and a PostgreSQL database.

A new user authentication system has been recently added, supporting OAuth2 (via GitHub for development) and API key authentication. The current task is to understand this new system, document it, and plan the next steps for its development.

# Product Context

## Problem Statement
Development and QA teams often struggle to get a clear, consolidated view of test results from their CI/CD pipelines. Test data is scattered across different systems, making it difficult to track trends, identify recurring failures, and understand the overall quality of the software.

## Target Audience
- **Developers**: Need to quickly see the results of their tests to identify and fix bugs.
- **Quality Assurance (QA) Engineers**: Need to track test coverage, identify flaky tests, and monitor the overall quality of the application.
- **DevOps Teams**: Need to monitor the health of the CI/CD pipeline and ensure that tests are running reliably.

## Core Value Proposition
This application provides a centralized platform for storing, viewing, and analyzing test results. By consolidating test data from various sources, it offers a single source of truth for software quality, enabling teams to make data-driven decisions and improve their development processes.

## User Experience Goals
- **Clarity**: The dashboard should present test data in a clear and intuitive way, with easy-to-understand visualizations.
- **Efficiency**: Users should be able to quickly find the information they need, with powerful filtering and search capabilities.
- **Accessibility**: The application should be easy to set up and use, with clear documentation and a straightforward user interface.

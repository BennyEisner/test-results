# Product Context

## Problem Solved

This platform solves the problem of decentralized and hard-to-analyze test results. It provides a central location for teams to store, view, and analyze their software testing data.

## How It Should Work

- **Web Interface:** Users can log in, view dashboards of test results, drill down into specific builds, test suites, and test cases. They can also manage their projects and API keys.
- **CLI:** Developers and CI/CD systems can use the CLI to upload test results and interact with the platform programmatically.

## User Experience Goals

- **Clarity:** Test results should be presented in a clear, easy-to-understand format.
- **Efficiency:** Users should be able to quickly find the information they need.
- **Security:** The authentication system should be secure and easy to use.

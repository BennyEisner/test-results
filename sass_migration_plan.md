# Sass Migration Plan

The following is a plan to migrate the project's Sass files to the modern module system, resolving all deprecation warnings without breaking the build.

### 1. Analyze Deprecation Warnings

The build output contains several deprecation warnings that need to be addressed:

-   **`@import` is deprecated**: The `@import` rule is being replaced by the modern `@use` rule.
-   **Global built-in functions are deprecated**: Functions like `mix()`, `unit()`, `red()`, `green()`, and `blue()` are being replaced by their equivalents in the `sass:color` and `sass:math` modules.
-   **`darken()` is deprecated**: The `darken()` function is being replaced by `color.adjust()`.

### 2. Incremental Migration Strategy

To avoid breaking the build, the migration will be performed incrementally:

1.  **Replace deprecated functions**: The `darken()` function will be replaced with `color.adjust()`, and all global built-in functions will be replaced with their modern equivalents.
2.  **Introduce `@use` with overrides**: The `@import` rules will be replaced with `@use`, and the `with` keyword will be used to apply custom variable overrides.
3.  **Verify the build**: After each change, the frontend container will be rebuilt to ensure the application is still in a working state.

### 3. Final Verification

Once all deprecation warnings have been resolved, the frontend container will be rebuilt one last time to confirm that the application is stable and ready for deployment.

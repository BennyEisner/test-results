# Setup Project Workflow

## Purpose
This workflow sets up the complete Cline infrastructure in any existing project by cloning the setup repository and executing the automated setup.

## Prerequisites
- Git installed and configured
- Existing project directory
- Access to the CLINE-SETUP repository

## Setup Steps

### 1. Navigate to Your Project
```bash
cd /path/to/your/existing-project
```

### 2. Clone Setup Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/BennyEisner/CLINE-SETUP.git
```

### 3. Execute Setup
```bash
./CLINE-SETUP/scripts/setup-project.sh
```

### 4. Optional: Clean Up
```bash
rm -rf CLINE-SETUP
```

## One-Liner Setup
For convenience, you can do everything in one command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CLINE-SETUP.git && ./CLINE-SETUP/scripts/setup-project.sh && rm -rf CLINE-SETUP
```

## What Gets Created
After setup, your project will have:
- `.clinerules/` - Active rules for this project
- `clinerules-bank/` - Rule templates and environments
- `memory-bank/` - Project context and memory files
- `scripts/` - Cline management scripts
- `workflows/` - Development workflows

## Verification
Check that all directories were created:
```bash
ls -la .clinerules/
ls -la clinerules-bank/
ls -la memory-bank/
ls -la scripts/
ls -la workflows/
```
